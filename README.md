Most of these Short Range FM transmitters plug into the device's headphone jack and then broadcast the signal over an FM broadcast band frequency, so that it can be picked up by any nearby radio.  This allows portable audio devices to make use of the louder or better sound quality of a home audio system or car stereo without requiring a wired connection. Being low-powered, most transmitters typically have a short range of 100–300 feet (30–100 meters), depending on the quality of the receiver, obstructions and elevation. Typically they broadcast on any FM frequency from 87.5 to 108.0 MHz in most of the world .
